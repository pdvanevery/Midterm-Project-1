Midterm Project 1: Create a browser game
GOAL OF GAME: 
Get your opponent's health to 0 by clicking any of the 4 action buttons. 

Click any action button to start game

When a move is clicked, the game rolls a dice for that move, the stronger the move is, the lower the chance you have of it landing and dealing damage.

Light attack is almost guaranteed to hit
Medium attack hits most of the time
Heavy attack hits about half of the time
Counter hits less than half of the time

Counter can heal you if it succeeds, otherwise you will take a small amount of damage

Once the game has been started, text will start to display, showing the outcome of your move and the outcome of your opponent's move
